It makes good eating on its own and also pairs well with a wide range of other flavors. This crab is likely to appeal to most people as it has no offensive or overpowering taste",

Onions are low in nutrients but are valued for their flavour and are used widely in cooking.

In fact, in Canada, 97% of lobster fisheries are MSC certified. Known for its firm, sweet meat, American lobster holds up well to a variety of cooking styles, and no one can agree on whether the claw or tail meat is better!",
